### Our History

OAPA was formed during the 1930s as the Omaha City Panhellenic Association. OCPA joined the National Panhellenic Conference in 1952, and changed its name in the mid-1970s. OAPA includes alumnae representatives from most of the National Panhellenic Conference sororities.

In 2002, OAPA became a charter member of the NPC Centennial Endowment Fund, to provide ongoing support for programs which encourage sorority women to strive academically, to develop leadership capabilities, and to develop the skills necessary to address risk management issues. Our $1000 donation continues to help fund these programs.

Today, OAPA delegates enjoy the social interaction and accomplishment our programs provide the Omaha area. Delegates take information back to their alumnae chapters and associations, which helps further the Panhellenic spirit. 

If your NPC sorority does not currently have a delegate, please contact us and attend a meeting. We invite you to join us!
