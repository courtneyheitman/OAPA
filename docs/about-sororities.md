It’s only natural to have questions. OAPA is here to help.

## What is a sorority?
A sorority is a social membership organization for women that provides strong friendships, lifelong bonds, and shared experiences. Women usually join sororities in college, but continue to enjoy the benefits of sisterhood as alumnae. 

The [National Panhellenic Conference](http://www.npcwomen.org) (NPC) is the umbrella group for 26 national and international sororities. These organizations function autonomously, but share common goals and purposes.

In Nebraska, NPC sororities are represented at Creighton University, University of Nebraska Omaha, University of Nebraska Lincoln, Nebraska Wesleyan and University of Nebraska Kearney. If you’re headed out of state, contact your college for a list of which chapters are on campus.

## How can I join a sorority?
Each college campus has its own process for sorority recruitment. Check with your campus student organizations office for details -- or ask a member of a sorority! They’re the ones wearing the Greek letters.

## What other benefits does sorority membership offer?
Sorority life offers opportunities in leadership, scholarship and community service, in addition to social activities. In a local college chapter, a woman will experience working together to accomplish many projects, interacting with other students, alumnae advisors and national staff, college administrators and the community. Academic achievement is emphasized, and many organizations offer scholarships. Chapters participate in community service projects giving back at the campus and national levels.

Lifetime membership in a sorority means that after college, alumnae membership will continue to enjoy a network of personal and professional development. Wherever life takes you, you are likely to find other sorority women and connect.

NPC sororities are located on more than 670 campuses with 411,242 undergraduate members in 3,288 chapters. Alumnae are represented in 3,784 associations throughout the world.
