As sorority women, we believe that we should give back to our community as much as we can. During the month of October, Omaha Alumnae Panhellenic will be participating in a Month of Giving, including donations to the Maverick Food Pantry and cooking a meal with the Rainbow House.


### Maverick Food Pantry

We will be collecting donations via PayPal to help with the University of Nebraska - Omaha Food Pantry. Food insecurity is becoming a bigger issue on college campuses, UNO included. Students saw this issue, and started their own student run food pantry.

Please donate whatever you can on PayPal.

### Rainbow House

We will be partnering with the women of Alpha Gamma Delta in serving a meal at the Rainbow House on Thursday, October 18th. ADG's will be setting up and serving the meal, but need help in supplying the food. Below is the link to sign-up for making/bringing food to the Rainbow House. 

Rainbow House is stocked with full kitchen and has multiple ovens, stove tops, dishwashers and a large refrigerator so women are welcome to either prepare and cook there or bring it ready to serve at Rainbow House. We serve by 6:30p.m. so members should arrive prior to that. We would suggest disposable pans as serving dishes.  

It would also be helpful if people could put what the breakfast casseroles include for allergen purposes. Something as simple as Sausage & Egg with Green Peppers works just fine.
