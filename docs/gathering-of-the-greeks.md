OAPAâ€™s Gathering of the Greeks is an annual celebration of the Panhellenic spirit! It is our premier social occasion of the year. Sorority members, both collegians and alumnae, from the metro Omaha area and Nebraska are invited to attend.

Our [scholarships and awards]({{ site.github.url }}/applications) are presented at the Gathering of the Greeks. Attendees enjoy brunch and a keynote speaker. Our silent auction and raffle benefit the scholarship fund for the following year. Collegiate members mingle with alumnae. Members of all organizations enjoy being Greeks together.

See our [past women of the year]({{ site.github.url }}/past-winners "past winners").
