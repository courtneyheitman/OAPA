The Omaha Alumnae Panhellenic Association serves the Omaha area community and its Panhellenic
women with [scholarships]({{ site.github.url }}/scholarships), [service awards]({{ site.github.url }}/applications), and a celebratory annual [Gathering of the Greeks]
({{ site.github.url }}/gathering-of-the-greeks).

Each year, OAPA awards more than $2,000 in scholarships and gifts to collegiate women. We recognize
outstanding women with Collegian of the Year and Alumnae of the Year awards for leadership and
participation in campus and community activities. OAPA also provides resources for local chapters and
potential new members (link).

Awards are made at our annual Gathering of the Greeks, an event that includes representatives from
many campuses and many sororities. The silent auction and raffle contribute to the scholarship fund for
the following year. We welcome you to explore the information and applications here, and participate in
this Panhellenic event.

OAPA is a proud member of the National Panhellenic Conference since 1974. NPC is an umbrella
organization for 26 international women&#39;s fraternities and sororities. NPC groups are represented on
more than 655 college and university campuses in the United States and Canada and in over 4,500
alumnae associations, involving more than 3.9 million women.

Each year, NPC women donate more than $5 million to worthy causes, provide 2.8 million in
scholarships to women and volunteer 500,000 hours in their communities.

The National Panhellenic Conference Creed
*We, as Fraternity Women, stand for service through the development of character inspired by the
close contact and deep friendship of individual fraternity and Panhellenic life. The opportunity
for wide and wise human service, through mutual respect and helpfulness, is the tenet by which
we strive to live.*
