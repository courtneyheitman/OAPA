### Scholarships

OAPA awards $1000 scholarships annually to outstanding women attending a Nebraska college or university. The scholarships help support local NPC members to strive academically and develop wide and wide human service to the Nebraska college community. Scholarships are awarded to members of NPC organizations who are juniors rising to seniors. Two or more scholarships are awarded each year at our Gathering of the Greeks event.

### Awards

OAPA presents two awards each year, to a Distinguished Senior of the Year and a Woman of the Year. It is our pleasure to recognize outstanding women who exemplify wide and wise human service and contribute to the development of character, as stated in the National Panhellenic Conference Creed. Selection criteria include service to fraternity, and service to campus or community. Distinguished Senior of the Year is presented to a graduating senior member of an NPC organization at Creighton University or University of Nebraska Omaha. Woman of the Year is presented to an alumna member of an NPC organization in the Omaha area.

We invite you to explore this award and nominate a woman from your organization.
