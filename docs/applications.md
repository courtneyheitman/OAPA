### Scholarships

OAPA awards $1000 scholarships annually to outstanding women attending a Nebraska college or university. The scholarships help support local NPC members to strive academically and develop wide and wide human service to the Nebraska college community. Scholarships are awarded to members of NPC organizations who are juniors rising to seniors. Two or more scholarships are awarded each year at our Gathering of the Greeks event.

We invite you to apply for this [scholarship](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RMkFdp1iuioF65wEmGc1DMHGds8wnQsksiEwVZBSNl8/edit?usp=sharing), and encourage you to spread the word to other sorority women!

### Awards

It is our pleasure to recognize outstanding women who exemplify wide and wise human service and contribute to the development of character, as stated in the National Panhellenic Conference Creed. Selection criteria include service to fraternity, and service to campus or community. 

We invite you to explore this award and nominate a woman from your organization. We would love for you to apply for [Woman of the Year](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XO69-sx-0ljdvcNMcNf8JLO94MtQEC8m/view?usp=sharing).
