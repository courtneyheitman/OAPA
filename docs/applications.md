### Awards

OAPA presents two awards each year, to a Collegian of the Year, and a Woman of the Year. It is our pleasure to recognize outstanding women who exemplify wide and wise human service and contribute to the development of character, as stated in the National Panhellenic Conference Creed. Selection criteria include service to fraternity, and service to campus or community. Collegian of the Year is presented to a graduating senior member of an NPC organization at Creighton University or University of Nebraska Omaha. Woman of the Year is presented to an alumna member of an NPC organization in the Omaha area.

We invite you to explore this award and nominate a woman from your organization. If you would like more information about applying click here(link).
