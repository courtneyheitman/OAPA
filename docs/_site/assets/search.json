    "excerpt": "\n",
    "content": "It’s only natural to have questions. OAPA is here to help. What is a sorority? A sorority is a social membership organization for women that provides strong friendships, lifelong bonds, and shared experiences. Women usually join sororities in college, but continue to enjoy the benefits of sisterhood as alumnae. The National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) is the umbrella group for 26 national and international sororities. These organizations function autonomously, but share common goals and purposes. In Nebraska, NPC sororities are represented at Creighton University, University of Nebraska Omaha, University of Nebraska Lincoln, Nebraska Wesleyan and University of Nebraska Kearney. If you’re headed out of state, contact your college for a list of which chapters are on campus. How can I join a sorority? Each college campus has its own process for sorority recruitment. Check with your campus student organizations office for details – or ask a member of a sorority! They’re the ones wearing the Greek letters. What other benefits does sorority membership offer? Sorority life offers opportunities in leadership, scholarship and community service, in addition to social activities. In a local college chapter, a woman will experience working together to accomplish many projects, interacting with other students, alumnae advisors and national staff, college administrators and the community. Academic achievement is emphasized, and many organizations offer scholarships. Chapters participate in community service projects giving back at the campus and national levels. Lifetime membership in a sorority means that after college, alumnae membership will continue to enjoy a network of personal and professional development. Wherever life takes you, you are likely to find other sorority women and connect. NPC sororities are located on more than 670 campuses with 411,242 undergraduate members in 3,288 chapters. Alumnae are represented in 3,784 associations throughout the world. Where can I get more information? Check out The Sorority Life! There you’ll find all kinds of information on recruitment, member organizations and the college lifestyle. Parents, still have questions? Visit The Sorority Life: The Real Deal, or the National Panhellenic Conference site. Or contact any of the OAPA delegates. ",

OCPA joined the National Panhellenic Conference in 1952, and changed its name in the mid-1970s. OAPA includes alumnae representatives from most of the National Panhellenic Conference sororities. In 2002, OAPA became a charter member of the NPC Centennial Endowment Fund, to provide ongoing support for programs which encourage sorority women to strive academically, to develop leadership capabilities, and to develop the skills necessary to address risk management issues. Our $1000 donation continues to help fund these programs. Today, OAPA delegates enjoy the social interaction and accomplishment our programs provide the Omaha area. Delegates take information back to their alumnae chapters and associations, which helps further the Panhellenic spirit. If your NPC sorority does not currently have a delegate, please contact us and attend a meeting. We invite you to join us! See our past presidents. ",

During the month of October, Omaha Alumnae Panhellenic will be participating in a Month of Giving, including donations to the Maverick Food Pantry and cooking a meal with the Rainbow House. Maverick Food Pantry We will be collecting donations via PayPal to help with the University of Nebraska - Omaha Food Pantry. Food insecurity is becoming a bigger issue on college campuses, UNO included. Students saw this issue, and started their own student run food pantry. Please donate whatever you can on PayPal.  Rainbow House We will be partnering with the women of Alpha Gamma Delta in serving a meal at the Rainbow House on Thursday, October 18th. ADG’s will be setting up and serving the meal, but need help in supplying the food. Below is the link to sign-up for making/bringing food to the Rainbow House. Rainbow House is stocked with full kitchen and has multiple ovens, stove tops, dishwashers and a large refrigerator so women are welcome to either prepare and cook there or bring it ready to serve at Rainbow House. We serve by 6:30p.m. so members should arrive prior to that. We would suggest disposable pans as serving dishes. It would also be helpful if people could put what the breakfast casseroles include for allergen purposes. Something as simple as Sausage &amp; Egg with Green Peppers works just fine.
